things not sure what to do woth:
mechanics - include evaluators??
quests
world

setters/getters:
armor
entity
Material
items
Skills
Status
Weapon

think of a way to store all of the armor, weapons .etc instances

think of game mechanics
think of dialogue

simple gui with boxes for example

think of effects to evaluate

do ids for all ones that require one - see items
